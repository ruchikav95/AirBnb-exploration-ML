## Project Objectives
Our primary objectives are:
- Analyzing neighborhood popularity for superhosts and non-superhosts, based on traffic, types of rooms (private rooms/shared rooms/entire apartment), and price of Airbnb in New York
- Drawing a comparison between the pre- and post-COVID listing prices
- Predicting the type of host (superhosts/non-superhosts) and understanding what attributes contribute to the classification of a superhost
- Predicting the price for Airbnb listings in New York City and understanding what features contribute to profitable business opportunities for Airbnb

## Data Source
Our datasets were taken from InsideAirbnb and it was last updated on October 2020. Each row of the "Listings" dataframe represents a listing on Airbnb, containing information about the property itself and the host.
